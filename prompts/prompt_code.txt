Please analyze the legacy codebase provided between the <legacy_code>  tags. 
The legacy application represents a database-driven web application with legacy tech stack provided between the <legacytech_stack> tags.

Legacy Tech stack:
<legacytech_stack></legacytech_stack>

Legacy code:
<legacy_code></legacy_code>

Target Technology Stack:
<moderntech_stack></moderntech_stack>

# Modern Implementation
   Please rewrite the application using the modern technology stack specified in the <moderntech_stack> tags, focusing on:
   - Referencing the code in legacy_code tags, implement ONLY code using moderntech_stack
   - Ignore all the UI code in legacy_ui tags, because that is handled elsewhere
   - Do NOT add any text. The output is ONLY code in code blocks
   - Modern best practices and design patterns
   - Improved security and error handling
   - Better performance and scalability
   - Clean architecture principles
   - Type safety and input validation
   - Comprehensive testing strategy
   - Documentation and maintainability
   - Make sure the whole code is provided for all the code files with full implementation

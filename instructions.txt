Create a Golang function that:
Takes a directory path as an input parameter.
If the path is empty string , path should be read from LEGACY_CODE_PATH in the .env file

Recursively traverses through:
The specified directory
All its subdirectories
ONLY the *.py and *.html files in these directories
ignore any subdirectories with .venv

Build a long combined string with:
- file name as "# <filename>"
- file's contents
- write it all to single output.txt file

This contents of this output.txt file should contain all *.py and *.html file contents.

**Legacy Codebase Documentation**
==============================

### Architecture Overview and Main Components

The legacy codebase is a simple Flask web application that interacts with a PostgreSQL database. The main components include:

*   **`app.py`**: The main application file that sets up the Flask app and defines the routes for the web application.
*   **`hello.py`**: An unused Python file that prints a message when executed.
*   **`add.html`**, **`edit.html`**, and **`list.html`**: The HTML templates for adding, editing, and listing employees, respectively.

### Key Business Logic and Workflows

The business logic of the application revolves around creating, reading, updating, and deleting (CRUD) employee records. The workflows are straightforward:

*   **Adding an employee**: The user fills out a form with the employee's name and age, and the application inserts a new record into the database.
*   **Editing an employee**: The user selects an employee to edit, makes changes to the form, and the application updates the corresponding record in the database.
*   **Deleting an employee**: The user selects an employee to delete, and the application removes the corresponding record from the database.
*   **Listing employees**: The application retrieves all employee records from the database and displays them in a table.

### Database Schema and Relationships

The database schema is simple, with a single table `employees` containing the following columns:

*   `id`: A unique identifier for each employee (primary key).
*   `name`: The employee's name.
*   `age`: The employee's age.

There are no relationships between tables.

### External Dependencies and Integrations

The application uses the following external dependencies:

*   **`psycopg`**: A PostgreSQL database adapter for Python.
*   **`Flask`**: A micro web framework for Python.
*   **`dotenv`**: A library for loading environment variables from a `.env` file.

**Technical Debt and Potential Issues**
=====================================

### Security Vulnerabilities

*   **SQL injection**: The application uses string formatting to build SQL queries, which makes it vulnerable to SQL injection attacks.
*   **Cross-site scripting (XSS)**: The application does not sanitize user input, which makes it vulnerable to XSS attacks.

### Performance Bottlenecks

*   **Database connections**: The application creates a new database connection for each request, which can lead to performance issues under high traffic.
*   **Unnecessary database queries**: The application retrieves all employee records when listing employees, which can be inefficient if the number of employees is large.

### Maintainability Concerns

*   **Code organization**: The application has a simple code structure, but it can be improved by separating concerns and using more descriptive variable names.
*   **Error handling**: The application does not have comprehensive error handling, which can make it difficult to debug issues.

### Outdated Dependencies or Deprecated Features

*   **`psycopg` version**: The version of `psycopg` used in the application may be outdated, which can lead to security vulnerabilities or performance issues.
*   **Python version**: The application uses Python 3, but it may not be compatible with the latest Python versions.

### Missing Error Handling or Edge Cases

*   **Database connection errors**: The application does not handle database connection errors, which can lead to unexpected behavior.
*   **Invalid user input**: The application does not validate user input, which can lead to unexpected behavior or errors.

### Code Smells and Anti-Patterns

*   **Global variables**: The application uses global variables, which can make it difficult to understand and maintain the code.
*   **Tight coupling**: The application has tightly coupled components, which can make it difficult to change or replace individual components.

*   **Chi framework**: The modern implementation uses the Chi framework, which provides a lightweight and flexible way to build web applications.
*   **HTMX library**: The modern implementation uses the HTMX library, which provides a simple way to create interactive web applications.
*   **Tailwind CSS**: The modern implementation uses Tailwind CSS, which provides a utility-first approach to styling web applications.
*   **Database migration tool**: The modern implementation uses a database migration tool to manage changes to the database schema.
*   **Comprehensive testing strategy**: The modern implementation includes a comprehensive testing strategy that covers unit testing, integration testing, and end-to-end testing.
*   **Improved security features**: The modern implementation includes improved security features, such as input validation, error handling, and secure password storage.
*   **Clean architecture principles**: The modern implementation follows clean architecture principles, which separate concerns and provide a clear structure for the application.

**High-Level Documentation of the Legacy Codebase**

### Architecture Overview and Main Components

The legacy codebase is a simple web application built using Flask, a Python micro web framework. The application is composed of the following main components:

*   `app.py`: The Flask application instance, responsible for routing requests and rendering templates.
*   `templates`: A directory containing HTML templates for the application's views (list, add, edit).
*   `hello.py`: A simple Python script that prints a message when executed (not integrated with the Flask app).

### Key Business Logic and Workflows

The application provides a simple CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) interface for managing employee data. The key business logic is implemented in the `app.py` file and can be summarized as follows:

*   **List Employees**: The `/` route queries the database for a list of employees and renders the `list.html` template.
*   **Add Employee**: The `/add` route handles the creation of new employee records.
*   **Edit Employee**: The `/edit/<id>` route retrieves an employee record by ID and allows editing.
*   **Delete Employee**: The `/delete/<id>` route deletes an employee record by ID.

### Database Schema and Relationships

The application uses a PostgreSQL database, but the schema is not explicitly defined in the code. However, based on the SQL queries, the `employees` table seems to have the following columns:

*   `id`: A unique identifier for each employee (primary key).
*   `name`: The employee's name.
*   `age`: The employee's age.

### External Dependencies and Integrations

The application uses the following external dependencies:

*   `Flask`: A Python micro web framework.
*   `psycopg2`: A PostgreSQL database adapter for Python.
*   `dotenv`: A library for loading environment variables from a `.env` file.

**Technical Debt & Potential Issues**

### Security Vulnerabilities

*   **SQL Injection**: The application uses string formatting to construct SQL queries, which makes it vulnerable to SQL injection attacks.
*   **Lack of Input Validation**: The application does not validate user input, which could lead to data corruption or security breaches.

### Performance Bottlenecks

*   **Database Connection Management**: The application creates a new database connection for each request, which can be inefficient and lead to performance issues.

### Maintainability Concerns

*   **Code Organization**: The `app.py` file contains both application logic and database interactions, making it harder to maintain and scale.

### Outdated Dependencies or Deprecated Features

*   **psycopg2**: The application uses `psycopg2`, which is an outdated PostgreSQL adapter. It is recommended to upgrade to `psycopg3` or use a more modern adapter like `pg8000`.

### Missing Error Handling or Edge Cases

*   **Database Errors**: The application does not handle database errors properly, which can lead to unexpected behavior and crashes.

### Code Smells and Anti-Patterns

*   **Duplicate Code**: The `list`, `add`, `edit`, and `delete` routes share similar database interaction logic, which could be extracted into a separate function or service.

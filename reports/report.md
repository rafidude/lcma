**Legacy Codebase Analysis**
=====================================

### Architecture Overview and Main Components

The legacy codebase is a simple web application built using Flask, a micro web framework for Python. The application has three main components:

*   **Database**: The application uses a PostgreSQL database to store employee data.
*   **Backend**: The Flask application provides RESTful APIs to interact with the database. It handles CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations for employees.
*   **Frontend**: The application uses HTML templates to render the user interface. It provides basic pages for listing employees, adding new employees, editing existing employees, and deleting employees.

### Key Business Logic and Workflows

The key business logic of the application is centered around employee management. The main workflows include:

*   **Employee Listing**: The application displays a list of all employees in the database.
*   **Employee Addition**: Users can add new employees by submitting a form with the employee's name and age.
*   **Employee Editing**: Users can edit existing employees by submitting a form with the employee's updated name and age.
*   **Employee Deletion**: Users can delete existing employees by clicking a delete button.

### Database Schema and Relationships

The database schema consists of a single table `employees` with the following columns:

*   `id` (primary key, auto-incrementing integer)
*   `name` (string)
*   `age` (integer)

There are no relationships between tables, as there is only one table in the schema.

### External Dependencies and Integrations

The application has the following external dependencies:

*   **Flask**: The application uses Flask as its web framework.
*   **psycopg**: The application uses psycopg to interact with the PostgreSQL database.
*   **dotenv**: The application uses dotenv to load environment variables from a `.env` file.

### Technical Debt and Potential Issues

#### Security Vulnerabilities

*   **SQL Injection**: The application is vulnerable to SQL injection attacks because it uses string formatting to construct SQL queries.
*   **Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)**: The application does not implement CSRF protection, making it vulnerable to attacks.

#### Performance Bottlenecks

*   **Database Connection Management**: The application creates a new database connection for each request, which can lead to performance issues under high traffic.
*   ** Lack of Caching**: The application does not implement caching, which can lead to performance issues due to repeated database queries.

#### Maintainability Concerns

*   **Tight Coupling**: The application has tight coupling between its components, making it difficult to modify or extend the application.
*   **Lack of Logging**: The application does not implement logging, making it difficult to diagnose issues.

#### Outdated Dependencies or Deprecated Features

*   **Flask Version**: The application uses an outdated version of Flask.
*   **psycopg Version**: The application uses an outdated version of psycopg.

#### Missing Error Handling or Edge Cases

*   **Database Errors**: The application does not handle database errors properly, which can lead to unexpected behavior.
*   **Validation Errors**: The application does not validate user input properly, which can lead to unexpected behavior.

#### Code Smells and Anti-Patterns

*   **Global Variables**: The application uses global variables to store database configuration, which can lead to issues with maintainability and scalability.
*   ** Duplicate Code**: The application has duplicate code in its CRUD operations, which can lead to issues with maintainability.
